## 1.Summary

Our project aims to explore how yearly variations in global climate conditions relate to performance patterns in Formula 1 racing. Formula 1 fascinates us precisely because it’s a symphony of engineering brilliance and human reflex: the split‑second timing in the pits, the constant tweaks in aerodynamic packages, and the relentless data analysis unfolding in the garage while drivers fight for tenths of a second on track. Every regulation change brings new unknowns, and every venue — from the damp elevation of São Paulo to the desert night of Abu Dhabi — layers fresh complexity onto strategy. By investigating weather and climate alongside race results we aim to spotlight an often‑mentioned but rarely quantified variable: how much do Mother Nature’s mood swings tilt the battlefield?We're curious to explore how these external factors might impact the top of the "driving foodchain", which is Formula One championships.We are motivated by the intensity and excitement of Formula One and the exquisite cooperation between the engineering team and the drivers. We like the mechanical design and the constantly innovative aerodynamic system of these cars, which makes the championship always full of unknowns. We want to judge the impact of weather on the championship through the drivers' race records and the historical level of the team's vehicles, the performance of different tracks and countries.

I explored Formula 1 race results from 2010 to 2023, focusing on how different constructors performed over time. One of the key visualizations I created was a bar chart showing the number of wins by each constructor. This visualization provided a clear, immediate understanding of which teams have dominated the sport in recent years. By using a vibrant colormap, each constructor was assigned a unique color, making the chart both visually appealing and easy to interpret. The bar chart revealed that a few constructors, such as Mercedes and Red Bull, have significantly more wins compared to others, highlighting the competitive imbalance in F1 during this period.Some insights we find out is the best team are Williams,McLaren, Red Bulls, Ferrari & Mercedes. Best Driver are Lewis Hamilton,Sebastian Vettel&Max Verstappen. 2019&2020 is the fast season ever which Lewis Hamilton from Mercedes driven W11 also being consider as the one the fastest F1 vehicle in the F1 history.Overall, the visualizations and data processing steps  from datawrangling workbook not only made the data more accessible but also uncovered important trends in team performance, driver consistency, and the evolving landscape of Formula 1 racing. These insights can inform deeper statistical analysis or predictive modeling in future work.
